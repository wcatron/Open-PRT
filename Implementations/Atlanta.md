# Atlanta

## Georgia Tech

Initially pilot the system in a small controlled environment, Georgia Institute of Technology. Restrict all access to cars and create temporary parking lots at the edges of the system to accomidate faculty and students who live off campus.

### Temporary & Existing Parking

The plan is to constantly increase the perimeter of the PRT system and parking garages are necessary to service those not living inside the area who drive to it. These parking garages would be useless however once the parimeter increases. Some flat parking lots can be built on top of. Create designs should be implemented that allow parking garages to transition to fully functional buildings. A hotel with a center atrium towering all the way up to the top could have been a parking garage with a center ramp circling to the top. An office building could have been a parking garage which had it's back ramp section torn off and replaced with elevators. Two story appartment complex could have been a two story parking garage which had a ramp up to the second floor. Unique ideas must be implemented in order to plan for the future. Similarily parking garages which already exist inside the PRT system can either be used to store PodCars or repurposed. Parking lots could become buidlings allowing schools like Georgia Tech which is constrained inside a city a large amount of undeveloped land.

## Expand to suburbs

Atlanta also has many suburbs which commuters commute to and from each day. Traffic congestion is a major problem for the city of atlanta. By adding a rail system down the center of many highways and again installing temporary parking garages at the stations for these rail systems, many cars could be removed from the daily commute.

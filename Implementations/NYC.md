# NYC

==========

## Phases

### Phase 1

Section of parts of NYC to make car free and use only podcar transportation within them. Take the block around Central Park up to the parrallel streets and remove all car transporation. This would clean up some of the noise polution around the fringes of the park and allow anyone to quickly go from one side to the other. A podcar could be called up to any street. Podcar parking would be built under some streets.

### Phase 2

One subway route would be taken down to be replaced by podcars which would travel along the rail instead. Some stations would just be drop off points others would be on ramps up to street level. From those stations you would section of the surrounding 4 city blocks for podcars only. This would allow point to point travel for many while still leaving in place station to station travel that would still be point to point. 

### Phase 3

Expand the scope of the podcar sections to control another city block in all directions. Drastically increase number of podcars.

### Phase 4-n

Continue to replace subway stations with podcar stations and slowly restrict all automobile access to manhattan in favor of podcars.

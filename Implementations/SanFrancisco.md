# San Francisco

It is most likely that if self-driving cars were to emerge. A certain California company will do it (Google). That along with San Francisco's geological placement makes it a strong candidate for a crossover of a self-driving and PodCar system.

## Cross Over

The cross over system allows for personally owned self-driving cars or personally owned drivable PodCars to immediatly integrate with the PodCar system or Crossover whenever they enter the PRT system. San Francisco has basically 4 major routes in. Self-driving cars are able to follow the traditional rules of the road while also opperating as PodCars in the PRT system. Drivable PodCars opperate like normal human operable vehicals until they get within the PodCar system. The latter is easier to produce however the former looks likely to be developed first.

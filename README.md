Open PRT
========

*The Internet of Transportation*

Open source documentation and protocols for a scalable Personal Rapid Transit (PRT, aka: PodCar) system.

**Vision**

To create a standard for communication between riders, podcars and decentralized servers to maintain a PRT system. Our inspiration comes from growth of the internet due to standards, openness, modularity, and healthy capitalism. We believe that any successful system will come about through a community effort and not by a single governing body, company or even a select few. 

## Based on the principles of the Internet


### User Experience

1. Rider uses a personal input device (phone, watch) to request a car either ASAP or for a scheduled time and their location. The rider also enters their destination.
2. The rider is given an identifier to look for.
3. The podcar then appears at the desired location displaying the identifier.
4. The rider gets in the podcar and rides to their final destination.
5. The rider gets off.

          <h3>What is Open PRT?</h3>
          <p>Personal Rapid Transit is a next generation transportation concept that allows travelers to travel via personal PodCars from their current location directly to their final location with no stops, no driving, and no other passengers. Open PRT is an advocate for PRT and seeks to offer a solution through standardization and partnerships with industry leaders and interested parties. We are focused on creating a standard for PRT installations that will allow for growth and innovation for the next century. To be clear there currently is not a singular Open PRT design but we are seeking interested partners to contribute to creating a design that could ultimately be implemented in Charleston and around the world.</p>

          <h4>Would you rather drive or ride?</h4>
          <p>Would you rather keep your eyes on the road or a TV show? Would you rather get stuck in traffic or in a good book? They call it the open road as if there's something inherently magical about it, turns out the things that make it magical are most likely inside the car. Either way, we still have windows.</p>

          <h4>Taking the public out of public transit.</h4>
          <p>Personal rapid transit is the epoch of public transportation. The #1 reason commuters prefer cars over buses and trains is they offer personal flexibality and privacy, while maintaining the virtues of public transportation like reduced costs and economic development.</p>

        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h4>Move people, and the economy.</h4>
          <p>Open PRT is designed around moving goods and service as much as it is moving people. Pods can move freight from ports and depots directly to their destinations at manufacturing plants and stores. All this with Zero-Emissions.</p>

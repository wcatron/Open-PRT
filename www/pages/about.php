<h2>About</h2>
<p>Open source documentation and protocols for a scalable Personal Rapid Transit (PRT, aka: PodCar) system.</p>

<p><b>Vision</b></p>

<p>To create a standard for communciation between riders, podcars and decenteralized servers to maintain a PRT system. Our inspiration comes from growth of the internet due to standards, openness and healthy capitalism. We believe that any successful system will come about through a community effort and not by a single governing body, company or even a select few. </p>

<p><h4>Who is Open PRT?</h4></p>
<p>Open PRT is an advocate for PRT and seeks to offer a solution through standardization and partnerships with industry leaders and interested parties. We are focused on creating a standard for PRT installations that will allow for growth and innovation for the next century. To be clear there currently is not a singular Open PRT design but we are seeking interested partners to contribute to creating a design that could ultimately be implemented in Charleston and around the world.</p>

Hi Weston,

I stumbled upon this project recently and it's very similar to what I've been thinking about recently.

If you have time, I'd love to hear more about your ideas and what happened with you project.

Best,
Davor

p.s. I couldn't find a working email to contact you and it seems GitHub doesn't have direct messaging.
